# Transaction Processing System  
### Mini Project – 24UCS271 Lab

---

## Objective
This mini project focuses on understanding, modifying, and extending a **Transaction Processing System** program. Students are expected to analyze existing code, improve it, and add new functionalities while following good coding practices.

---

## Reference Code
Review the given source code before starting the project:

## Tasks to be Performed

1. Compile and run the given executable code.
2. Perform your own testing of the program.
3. Add a new account detail and regenerate the `accounts.txt` file.
   - Inspect the contents of the file.
   - Verify whether the output matches your expectations.
4. Identify and fix any logical errors in the program.
5. Add new functionality  
   - Example: Listing all account information.
6. Optimize the program for better performance and efficiency.

## Troubleshooting: `trans.exe` blocked on Windows (Device Guard)

If you see an error like:

```
'C:\\...\\trans.exe' was blocked by your organization's Device Guard policy
```

this is a **Windows policy restriction**, not a bug in the C source code.

### Workarounds

1. **Compile from source on your own machine/toolchain** instead of running a prebuilt executable.
   - MinGW/GCC:
     ```bash
     gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o trans trans.c
     ./trans
     ```
2. **Run in Replit or another online IDE** (recommended in the project rules).
3. **Use WSL/Linux environment** and compile there.
4. If this is a managed college/company laptop, ask IT to allow unsigned student binaries.

> Tip: submit source code (`trans.c`) and build instructions, rather than sharing a precompiled `trans.exe`.
